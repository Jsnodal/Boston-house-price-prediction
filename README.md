In this house price prediction project, we start by loading the dataset and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and identify patterns. Initial steps include inspecting the dataset for missing values, which can be handled by either dropping or imputing them. We then visualize data distributions and correlations to identify key features related to house prices. Feature engineering involves selecting and scaling features to improve model performance. For this, we use a correlation matrix to determine which features have the strongest relationships with the target variable, and normalize the features to ensure consistent scales.

After preparing the data, we build a Linear Regression model by splitting the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). The results are visualized by plotting actual versus predicted values. The project concludes by discussing potential improvements, such as experimenting with different features, advanced algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
